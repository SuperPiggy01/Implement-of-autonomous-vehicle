# Implementation of autonomous vehicle
The project achieves goals:
1. Modular concept implememt not only in hardware but also software by using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
2. Created a radar-like detection device by combining an ultrasound model and a servomotor 
3. Embedded a linear regression algorithm for calibration of the wheels' movement accuracy
4. Achieved 100% evasion in avoiding the thick obstacles
5. Infered remote control in case the autonomous mal-function
